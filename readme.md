# CS489 - Applied Software Development

- CS489 - Applied Software Development (APSD) course
- Building Application by Applying Spring Boot, Relational DB, Non-Relational DB, Deployment, CI/CD and fronted technologies
- this repository contains all lessons, lab solutions and practice exercises, and project

## Goals
Software Development is the systematic process of conceiving, specifying, analyzing,
designing, programming, testing, documenting and maintaining involved in the production
of some System or Application Software.
In this course, students will learn how to produce enterprise-grade Software solution, by taking
requirements from conception through analysis, design, implementation and testing to delivery
and deployment of working software. The course will teach a set of the core principles, best
practices and the associated tools and technologies and how these are used and applied in the
production of high-quality, robust software solutions. The techniques and tools covered will
mostly be centered around, though not limited to, the Java software platform.
We will study the techniques for how to identify and elicit the correct requirements for a
software product, how to analysis these requirements and select a suitable software solution
architecture and create an appropriate design. And then, it will proceed to show how to
implement the design in code, including testing and ultimately how to build and package the
resulting artifact for delivery and deployment to production environment. We will consider
various modern software deployment mechanisms, including use of Containers and the Cloud.
